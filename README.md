# Floating Point Unit
This is a single-precision (Sp) and a double-precision (Dp) floating point unit (FPU) which could perform the main floating-point operations. 
The whole FPU is implemented in Verilog HDL. The FPU is designed to be compatible with the IEEE 754 standard. 

This project is a group project as a part of the Logic Design II (CMPN111) course at Cairo University. The project requirement description is available [here](Poject-Requirements.pptx).

It is a work in progress and is not yet complete.

## How to run the project
The project is implemented in Verilog HDL and is tested using the ModelSim simulator.
To run the project, you need to have ModelSim installed on your computer. 
Then, you need to open the project in ModelSim and add the `.v` files to the project.
After that, you need to compile the project and run the testbenches.
